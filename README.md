- Those installation steps won't break your windows, in case things didn't go well, all you need to do are:
  - ```winget uninstall ...``` all packages you have installed through ```install-packages.ps1```
  - Remove added task scheduler tasks
  - Remove added config files in ```~/.config```
- If you have just fresh install windows 11, you need to go to Microsoft Store and update your "App Installer". Otherwise winget will not working.
- For those who use another windows 11 version (like IOT Enterprise LTSC, which doesn't come with Microsoft Store):
  - First download the latest version of winget: <https://aka.ms/getwinget>
  - Then open Powershell and run: ```Add-AppxPackage -Path <path to downloaded .msixbundle>``` to install winget

 *üö© Continue below after MSYS2 has been installed through install-packages.ps1 and you have restarted the pc*

### Change MSYS2 home directory

Edit the "db_home"'s value to "windows" of file /c/msys64/etc/nsswitch.conf (file nsswitch.conf inside C:\msys64\etc)

```
db_home: windows
```

This will set windows user folder as default home directory. Otherwise zsh won't see it config file from user's directory.

### Install Zsh

Open **MSYS2 UCRT64** and run below command to install zsh (Tips: command can be pasted using middle mouse button)

```
# Update pacman
pacman -Syu

pacman -S zsh

```

Open **Powershell**, from your user folder (Example: ```C:\Users\aquapaka>```), run below command to install zsh themes and configs

```
# Install Theme: Powerlevel10k
