## üì¶ Step by Step Installation

### Pre-install notices

- Those installation steps are not fully verified and you might stuck at any step, if you're having problem, feel free to message me on my discord.
- This dotfiles and it's previews are in 2560x1600 resolution, everything might look bigger on lower resolution.
- Those installation steps won't break your windows, in case things didn't go well, all you need to do are:
  - ```winget uninstall ...``` all packages you have installed through ```install-packages.ps1```
  - Remove added task scheduler tasks
  - Remove added config files in ```~/.config```
- If you have just fresh install windows 11, you need to go to Microsoft Store and update your "App Installer". Otherwise winget will not working.
- For those who use another windows 11 version (like IOT Enterprise LTSC, which doesn't come with Microsoft Store):
  - First download the latest version of winget: <https://aka.ms/getwinget>
  - Then open Powershell and run: ```Add-AppxPackage -Path <path to downloaded .msixbundle>``` to install winget

### Install Fonts

Font need to be download and install manually *(Windows is planning to allows installing fonts from winget. Stay tune!)*:

- [Pixelcraft Nerd Font](https://github.com/aquapaka/Pixelcraft/releases) (please download and use Nerd Font version)
- [Pixel Code](https://qwerasd205.github.io/PixelCode/)
- [Monofur Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/Monofur.zip)

### Install chezmoi and apply dotfiles

### Install packages

- After chezmoi apply the dotfiles, the chezmoi source folder could be found in ```%userprofile%/.local/share/chezmoi```, ```install-packages.ps1``` file can be found inside ```scripts``` folder (‚ö†Ô∏èNote: Windows Terminal is now default open zsh shell which we haven't installed yet so it will show error if you try to open Windows Terminal, let's open Windows Powershell instead)
- Edit ```install-packages.ps1```, comment out packages/apps that are not needed (All non-required packages are commented by default)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If glazewm or zebar already installed, please uninstall them first before running the install script, this will make sure the versions are correct.
- Run ```install-packages.ps1``` script with **Powershell** to install nessesary packages (‚ö†Ô∏è Note: sometime installation could fail, re-run the script to ensure all packages has been installed)

### Add New Environment Variables

- Press Windows + S to open Search
- Find and open "edit environment variables for your account"
- Choose variable "Path" then click Edit
- Click New then add ```%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin```

### Restart

- After everything above are done, restart the PC one time to make sure all new program paths and fonts are registered.

----------------------------

 *üö© Continue below after MSYS2 has been installed through install-packages.ps1 and you have restarted the pc*

### Change MSYS2 home directory

Edit the "db_home"'s value to "windows" of file /c/msys64/etc/nsswitch.conf (file nsswitch.conf inside C:\msys64\etc)

```
db_home: windows
```

This will set windows user folder as default home directory. Otherwise zsh won't see it config file from user's directory.

### Install Zsh

Open **MSYS2 UCRT64** and run below command to install zsh (Tips: command can be pasted using middle mouse button)

```
# Update pacman
pacman -Syu

# Open MSYS2 Ucrt64 and install ZSH
pacman -S zsh

```

Open **Powershell**, from your user folder (Example: ```C:\Users\aquapaka>```), run below command to install zsh themes and configs

```
# Install Theme: Powerlevel10k

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ./.config/zsh/themes/powerlevel10k

# Install Fast Syntax Highlighting Plugin

git clone https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting ./.config/zsh/plugins/fast-syntax-highlighting

# Install Autosuggestions Plugin

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ./.config/zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

# Install History Substring Search Plugin

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search ./.config/zsh/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search
```

**Troubleshoot:** If git is not recognizable, try close and reopen powershell or check whether git is installed through running ```install-packages.ps1``` or not.

### Install VS Code Extensions for Theming

  - [Gruvbox Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jdinhlife.gruvbox) - *using by Wasabi theme*
